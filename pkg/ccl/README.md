# Cockroach Community License (CCL) packages

**Avoid adding new packages to this subdirectory**

This tree previously housed our non-Apache2 licensed Go packages. Such
packages were offered under the Cockroach Community License (ccl),
hence the name. By convention, all packages under this tree have the
suffix `ccl`.

All CockroachDB code is now offered under the CockroachDB Software
License, making this division unnecessary. Packages are slowly being moved out
of this subtree as time allows.
